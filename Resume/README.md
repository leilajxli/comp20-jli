The project contains 3 web pages, 1 style sheet and 1 picture. I used the same style sheet for the three webpage. In addition to a general text style for body, h1, h2, and h3, I used class and id selectors to refine box areas in the bio and resume pages. 

In the index.html, I attached a picture. In the style sheet, I shrank the picture and made the content aligned at the center.

Correctly implemented: 
- anchors to other pages 
- picture 

Wishlist for improvements: 
- perhaps a better design for the text and the picture
- mobile design, shrinkable picture 

In the resume.html, I use 3 header types. In the CSS style sheet, the div.indent class selector is used to override the text-alignment, changing it from center to left.

Implemented: 
- text, style

Wishlist:
- more text decoration styles, like underlines 
- maybe a background picture so it looks like a real resume 

In bio.html, I styled the page with the same class selector. 

Implemented: 
- text, style 

Wishlist: 
- make the page look prettier 


I spend approximately 6 hours on the project. Here is the breakdown: 
- 2 hours on reading notes and reviewing the workings of html and css
- 2 hours on writing the html pages 
- 1 hour on writing the style sheet 
- 1 hour on setting up the cs host and polishing everything 


I did not really discuss my work with anyone. Google and Piazza answered most of my questions. My housemate, Steph Xu, answered some of my questions about using the terminal, but nothing specific to my work.
