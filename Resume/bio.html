	<h1>Nice to meet you. My name is Jiaxun Leila Li.</h1>
	<p></p>
	<p>Curious, organized, versatile.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I am a senior studying Globalization at Tufts University. I am looking for a full-time job or research fellowship after my graduation in May 2019. My passion lies in the overlap of technology, business and international affairs. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>As a critical and eclectic thinker, I have researched on topics including trade, migration, and international business development. What drives me at a work is to create measurable impact. My professional experience includes operations, auditing and marketing.</p><p></p>
	<p>A believer of "living deliberately", I take pleasure in dance, photography, and cooking. I hope to connect the dots and share my pleasure with the world. </p>
