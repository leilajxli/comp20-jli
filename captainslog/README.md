   1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Correctly implemented...

- You are required to use jQuery for this lab! 
   - More importantly, messages must be stored in local storage so if you leave the page and return to the page, your messages are preserved and are redisplayed. 
   - You are not allowed to modify the HTML body section!

Work in progress...


   - Modify the page, your copy of index.html, so that entries entered (that is, on pressing the enter / return key) will be displayed dynamically (i.e., no page refresh) in the "log" section with the latest update showing first! 
   		- make a variable to store the input data √ 
   		- store the text of input data in local storage √ (do I store the date?)
   		- get the value in local storage √ 
   		- set an event listener, the event is press the enter/return key, the action is 
   		- 1. timestamp 
   		- 2. display the value in the local storage in log <div>
         - display the latest update first 		

   - A space followed by a hyphen followed by a space must follow the timestamp. 
   Example: Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005 - Hello all!. 


Not implemented...

   - All displayed messages must be preceded with a human readable timestamp (e.g., "Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005", Sun Mar 22 2015 16:05:32 GMT-0400 (EDT)")
