   - All displayed messages must be preceded with a human readable timestamp (e.g., "Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005", 

 
Sun Mar 22 2015 16:05:32 GMT-0400 (EDT)"). 
		A space followed by a hyphen followed by a space must follow the timestamp.

	- You are required to use jQuery for this lab! 
	- More importantly, messages must be stored in local storage so if you leave the page and return to the page, your messages are preserved and are redisplayed. 
	- You are not allowed to modify the HTML body section!
