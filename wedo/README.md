The goal of the project is to practice mixing Javascript with HTML. 

This lab helped me understand the idea of events. In the eventListener, I used timeupdate as a trigger event, and an anonymous function as an event listener. 

Thanks to the help of Michael Robinson!

I spent 2 hours reviewing the material, and 2.5 hours coding. Here is a record of how long I worked on the project:
