# Purpose 
This Git repository holds Jiaxun Li's work in COMP20 Fall 2018.

# Favorite 
My personal favorite is the MBTA assignment, which I spent an exorbitant amount of time on. This was my first step to becoming a Google developer. With the help of examples and TAs, I was able to put the pieces together and make a project with practical value. 

# Growth 
At day 1 of this course, I have forgotten the bulk of what I learned in COMP11, excited about web but don't know how to learn. Now I know how to learn more about web on my own. I know how to use git, curl, heroku. I can code in javascript, html and use a variety of frameworks and libraries. 

# Biggest takeaways 
- I became more comfortable with struggling and even failing. For the semester group project, I spent a lot of time cracking the secret of the Spotify authorization code flow, before I asked my teammates to read the docs with me. I was always confident my problem is either something very simple or very massive. But I was wrong. The concept is just beyond me. I could have asked for the TA's help earlier. 
- I learned to concentrate. For my other classes, I am able to map out the tasks, assign tasks to time blocks and following through that timeline. However, this is not the case for this class. I underestimated how time consuming it was to read docs and understand other people's code. On the bright side, such challenges uncovered my ability to concentrate and work in a flow. When I was reading the google map API and continuously testing my code, I found myself so hyper-focused I lost track of time. After 3 hours of focused work, the sense of fulfillment is insurmountable. My teammate said I'll be a good software developer - because I don't give up easily :D

# Delving deeper into 
- UX/UI design: how to make a webpage appealing and accessible 
- Cybersecurity and privacy related to my everyday use of web applications  
- Database APIs: during the summer I was tasked with funneling the data from Google Analytics to an Airtable spreadsheet. Some technical consultants wrote the code before me and I struggled to read his code. Now that I have learned to read API docs, I will be more comfortable taking on such tasks.
